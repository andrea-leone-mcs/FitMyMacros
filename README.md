# FitMyMacros
## Description
This project's goal is to practice **React Native** and **Typescript** by creating a simple app that calculates the user's daily macronutrient intake based on their goals.\
The choice of this project comes from a personal need of tracking macros and the lack of a simple, basic, clean app to do that. Most of the apps on the market compute the user's daily intake based on their weight, height, age, and activity level, but they don't allow the user to set a specific goal (at least not in the free version).

**FitMyMacros** is intended to be used by people with a basic understanding of macronutrients, calories, and their goals. Since there is no magic formula to calculate the perfect intakes, the user should set his goals on his own, based on his knowledge and personal experience. However, including a basic calculator to help the user set his goals is an idea for future development.

This application also comes with a new feature which is super useful for people who are following a _flexible dieting_ / _IIFYM_ approach. Once a meal is selected, the app allows the user to select three foods as main sources of carbs, proteins and fats. The user can set the amount of each macronutrient to reach for that meal, and the app will calculate the total amount of each food needed to reach the goal.\
For instance, if today I decide to eat pasta with olive oil and cheese, plus some chicken as a second dish, and I want to reach 80g of carbs, 20g of fats and 40g of proteins, the app will tell me how much pasta, oil, cheese and chicken I need to reach that goal.\
This is something I have often done manually, and I think it would be a great feature to have in a macro tracking app.

## User Interface
The UI is intended to be as simple and clean as possible: no fancy graphics and animations, just a basic, easy-to-use interface.\
Here follows a sample app usage:\
